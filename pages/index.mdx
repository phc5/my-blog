# Paul Chong

Hi, I'm a Front End Engineer at Facebook who is solving problems and building experiences that give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.

I love working with React.js, Next.js, GraphQL, and TailwindCSS. I've previously worked at Amazon Web Services and Cox Automotive.
